<p>Since there are library related differences between batches, as well as batch related sequencing artifacts, we first normalized the library sizes of the different batches. The plot below with the normalized counts shows the batch related artifacts more clearly after the library sizes have been normalized. This suggests that batch related artifacts need to be accounted for in our linear model when we do our differential gene expression analysis.</p>

<p>Differential expression analysis was carried out using limma/edgeR. Batch was included as a covariate in the linear model constructed for comparision. The heatmap and the volcano plot below show the expression differences of all significantly differentially expressed genes between MPNST and PNF samples. The cluster tree shows splitting of the differentially expressed genes into 4 main clusters according to expression patterns in the comparison groups.</p>

<p>The clusters of genes identified above were then subjected to pathway analysis using <em>gprofiler2</em> which uses hypergeometric test to examine enrichment of particular cellular pathways in the gene lists provided.</p>
<p>The Manhattan plots show the enrichment scores (logPvalues) for pathways in various databases (e.g.&nbsp;KEGG, REAC, GO:MF, GO:CC etc) that represent the genes in each of the identified clusters (Clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4). You can hover your cursor over the circles in the plots to get more information about the pathway indicated by the circle.</p>
<p>The table below each Manhattan plot shows the list of pathways enriched in specific clusters along with the pValue of enrichment.</p>
